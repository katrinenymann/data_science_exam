# Data science Exam code

Three different Machine Learning models for predicting strokes from biomarkers. As well as LIME and SHAP methods for interpretability. 

To reproduce the results from the Exam paper run the interpret_results.ipynb. This will take around 6 minutes, but can be done faster by selecting fewer observations in the LIME method. 

The exploration of the dataset can be found in the data_exploration notebook. 
The training of the models is in the analysis notebook.  

The packages required to run the code are mentioned in the requirements.txt 
The utils file contains all the functions created to run the notebooks.
